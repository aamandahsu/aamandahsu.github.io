      				<p id="title"><b>The Task</b></p>
      				<p id="body">Catfish was conceived during a 24-hour hackathon that the company that I interned for this past summer hosted. The goal of the hackathon was to create a game based off of one of the company's current projects. For privacy reasons, I'm unable to disclose what the project we chose was about but the purpose of our game was to emphasize how similarities between online profiles on different platforms could link multiple accounts that belong to the same person.</p>
      				<p id="title"><b>The Process</b></p>
      				<p id="body">As the lead designer for our team, I wanted to create an interface that was aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate for users. The goal was to create a game that was largely controlled by the computer to make the game easier to play and understand. For example, pop-ups indicate when users need to input information so not a lot of navigation between pages is needed on the users' end.  In addition, I wanted a simple design that allowed the player to only focus on the information that was of use to them.</p>
