      				<p id="title"><b>The Task</b></p>
      				<p id="body">At my internship this past summer, one of my favorite projects I worked on was designing wireframes for a mobile application created for government contractors to help guide them through the acquisition process. The acquisition process is very long and complicated (and dreadful to many) because there is typically a 1-2 year time deadline to complete numerous smaller projects, including conducting market research and writing reports, to name a few.  Many of the tasks on the acquisition timeline must be completed concurrently, while the completion of some tasks feed into ones that must be done at a later time. Thus, this process can be overwhelming for those who don't have much experience in this field. Our team sought to create a mobile app targeted at younger government employees who are new to contracting. </p>
      				<p id="title"><b>The Process</b></p>
      				<p id="body">One of the first things we did was create a user story to understand who would be using our app and the different features that would be most useful for them. A government acquisition requires a team of contractors featuring a project leader. Next, I researched other project management apps and websites to draw inspiration and analyze which features we could potentially utilize. I focused heavily on wedding planning apps because just like government acquisitions, the planning process is very convoluted and contains many moving parts. We also wanted to integrate a gaming aspect to the app to incentivize users to use the app and make the process more enjoyable. </p>
      				<p id="body">The biggest obstacle was coming up with a design for the schedule. I wanted users to be able to visualize how much progress they've made so far and the general timeline of tasks, especially the connectivity between the different tasks. It took many brainstorming sessions to figure out how to display multiple concurrent tasks while also conveying to the user the relationship between them. Because of the vertical nature of the mobile phone layout, I decided to use a vertical schedule that displayed upcoming tasks with pointers indicating relationships. The design of the schedule is pretty bare and since I just wanted to convey the general idea, but the team has continued where I left off!</p>
<!--       				<p id="body">With regards to adding gaming aspects into the app, I suggested a "boat" theme where all members of the team would be part of the crew and each completed task would allow them to get closer to their goal of completing their voyage. The team would be awarded with treasure as they made progress and there would even be an alternative schedule view that displayed a route of their journey and where they currently were. This would incentivize the team to keep going as they would be able to visualize their progress. </p> -->
      				<p id="body">We included personalized features that would increase productivity, efficiency, and team morale. When members created their profiles, they would also fill out a short quiz that asked about traits that could help the project lead cultivate a better team dynamic (Morning Lark vs. Night Owl, Social Butterfly vs. Lone Wolf). Using these traits, the project lead could schedule meetings at times that were preferable for attendees, group individuals who work in similar ways, and assign tasks to those with the most fitting skillset.</p>
      				<p id="title"><b>The Result</b><a href="https://youtu.be/RyJ1erGMJRY" id="video"> [Link] </a></p>
      				<p id="body">These initial designs allow for easy navigation to stories with a featured page that highlights daily top stories and a category page where users can find stories related to specific topics they're interested in. Currently, I'm in the process of designing higher-fidelity wireframes that show the flow of a user journey.</p>
